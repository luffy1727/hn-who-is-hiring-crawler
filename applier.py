As one of the lead developers who migrated the monolithic application into microservices, I have acquired hands-on experience with system design and AWS.\n\nYour listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:\n\n- Highly skilled in designing, testing, and developing loosely coupled systems\n- Thorough understanding of AWS features\n- Hands-on experience with microservices\n- Passion for automation (CI/CD)\n- 3 year experience of writing production-level code\n\nIâ€™ve attached a copy of my resume that includes the details of my projects and experience in software development.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.\n\nSincerely,\nChintushig Ochirsukh'
